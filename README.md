# Poppin' Bottles

## Descriptiopn
You've just been hired at Lighthouse Markets, a reputable (and thoroughly fictional) grocery store chain. One of the primary features of Lighthouse Markets is their recycling program on pop bottles. Here is how the program works:

For every two empty bottles, you can get one free (full) bottle of pop
For every four bottle caps, you can get one free (full) bottle of pop
Each bottle of pop costs $2 to purchase
Given these parameters, write a program so that you can figure out how many total bottles of pop can be redeemed given a customer investment.
